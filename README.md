# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction — Machine Learning Project

Ride-hailing platforms like Uber, Ola, and Lyft rely heavily on intelligent dispatching systems. One key factor that improves their efficiency is estimating **how long a driver will remain occupied with a trip**. If we can accurately predict taxi ride duration, the system can:

- Assign drivers more efficiently  
- Reduce customer wait time  
- Improve fleet utilization  
- Enhance user experience  

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** that predicts the total duration of taxi trips in New York City.

## Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates **total ride duration (in seconds)** for NYC taxi trips using trip-level features and spatial-temporal information.

---  

###  **Model Building**
- Baseline model for comparison  
- Regression models like:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost / Gradient Boosting  
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved results  

###  **Model Evaluation**
Metrics used:

MAE : Measures average prediction error 

RMSE : Penalizes larger errors 

R² Score : Indicates model performance quality 

---

## Key Learning Outcomes

Real-world ML workflow — from raw data to production-ready model  
Handling geospatial and time-series features  
Feature engineering for predictive performance  
Model selection + tuning for regression tasks  

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can accurately estimate **NYC taxi trip durations**, a task heavily relevant in ride-hailing systems. Such prediction systems can significantly improve fleet management, reduce wait times, and optimize driver dispatching across platforms like Uber and Ola.
